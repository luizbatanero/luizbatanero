Hello, I'm Luiz!

I'm a front-end engineer with a background in design, based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I'm interested in the React ecosystem, design systems and user experience.

Currently I'm working at [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br), the leading educational hub for developers in Latin America, where we empower devs to level up their careers.

You can reach me directly on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/luizbatanero) or [Twitter](https://x.com/luizbatanero). Looking forward to connecting!
